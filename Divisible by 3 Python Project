# Divisible by 3 Python Project  

## Project Description  
This Python project implements a function that determines whether an integer is divisible by 3. It demonstrates essential programming concepts such as control flow, conditional statements, and function creation.  

## Problem Statement  
Write a function `div_3()` that takes a single integer as input and returns:  
- `True`: if the integer is divisible by 3  
- `False`: otherwise  

Example:  
```python
div_3(6)  # Output: True
div_3(5)  # Output: False
